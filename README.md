# Infusion Live Tutorial Demo
A mockup of a live tutorial for the Infusion Framework. This demo currently uses embedded snippets from CodePen which are not editable on the page itself, in the final version this will not be the case as we will use an extended version of Fluid Sandbox which will allow the user to edit the code.

# Instructions on how to lauch the demo

- Clone the repo on your computer

- Install Node and npm for you computer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Navigate to your directory and launch a terminal and enter the following command :

```bash
npm install
```
- This will install all the dependencies required to run the demo

- Now finally launch the directory as a server using any method you wish or just start index.html (this will not load the codepen snippets)
