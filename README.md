# Infusion Live Tutorial
A mockup of a live tutorial for the Infusion Framework. This mock-up currently uses embedded snippets from CodePen which are not editable on the page itself, in the final version this will not be the case as we will use an extended version of Fluid Sandbox which will allow the user to edit the code.

# Instructions on how to launch the mockup

- Install Node and npm for your computer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Enter the following commands in a terminal (bash/cmd/powershell etc.) :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadxx7/infusion-live-tutorial.git
cd infusion-live-tutorial 
npm install
```
- This will clone the repo and install all the dependencies required to run the mockup

- Now launch the directory as a live server by entering the following commands in the terminal(or using any other method you wish):
```bash
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```
- Open your browser and enter the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

- Vola, you are now in!
