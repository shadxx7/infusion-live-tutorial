# Infusion Live Tutorial Demo
A mockup of a live tutorial for the Infusion Framework. This demo currently uses embedded snippets from CodePen which are not editable on the page itself, in the final version this will not be the case as we will use an extended version of Fluid Sandbox which will allow the user to edit the code.

# Instructions on how to launch the demo

- Clone the repo on your computer

- Install Node and npm for you computer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Navigate to the directory you cloned the repo inside and launch a terminal and enter the following command :

```bash
npm install
```
- This will install all the dependencies required to run the demo

- Now launch the directory as a live server by entering the following commands in the terminal(or using any other method you wish):
```bash
npm install -g live-server
live-server
```
- Open you browser and enter the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

- Vola, you are now in the demo!
